Crude but stealthy adblocker for youtube on chrome.
All it does is reloads the page and restores your progress through the video.
Its a chrome extention so to use it just download the files into a folder...
Then go to youtubechrome://extensions/
Enable developer mode
Then click 'load unpacked' and select the folder.
I hope you enjoy the theme and adfree videos :)
